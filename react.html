      React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library for building user
      interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and
      companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile
      applications. However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating
      React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for state management and
      routing. Redux and React Router are respective examples of such libraries.
